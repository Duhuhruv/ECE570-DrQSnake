To run code run in Google colab and change the filepath within the training loop to your own google drive folder you'd like to save results into. Once that filepath is correct everything should run self contained within the file. you can upload any of the .pth files I have in this repo to your google drive as well and change the filepath in the load checkpoint cell to it so you can test my already trained models.
